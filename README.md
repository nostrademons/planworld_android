PlanWorld Android client
=================

PlanWorld is an alumni-only social network of my alma mater, Amherst college.
This is intended to be an Android client so that I can check it on the go, and
also so that I can teach myself Android development.  There's likely little of
interest to passerby here, as the social network itself is limited to Amherst
alumni only and has just a few hundred members.
